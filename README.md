### What is this project?

I came up with the idea for ColoredGrids as a way to learn and implement solidity programming ideas that I haven't done before.

ColoredGrids is based around users owning 4x4 __grids__, each slot containing one of nine colors. When a __grid__ is generated it will have a totally random set of colors.<br>
The objective is to create interesting patterns or artwork by trading with other users. A user can pick any 2x2 area within a __grid__ they own and offer to trade that 2x2 area with another users 2x2 area of their own __grid__.<br>
Ether can be offered during these trades a 2x2 grid trade offer may be only beneficial for one party, to make it more appealing.

Four __grids__ can be combined together into a __set__. This allows for more creativity as you now can create an 8x8 set with more complex graphics or images.
